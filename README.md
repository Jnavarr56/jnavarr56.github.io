# Pokemon Database (Pokedex)

This is a dynamic dashboard that uses the official pokemon API to present general information and statistics on searched pokemon. Part of a bootcamp assignment, I decided to take it to another level and create an app that would present a comprehensive profile of each pokemon, even speaking various facts about the pokemon.

  - jQuery
  - CSS3
  - HTML5
  - Artyom.js (speech synthesis package)

# Deployed Using Github Pages

  - jnavarr56.github.io/mainPage.html
